## BetterDecals
Did you wanted to add a M2 decal to your poor rusty LAD? Now you can!

BetterDecals is a mod about giving more functionality to the decals in the game. The mod allows users to install their own custom decals (provided as .png / .jpg / .bmp) and also resize them.

### Showcase

### Installation
1. Go and download the lastest release (https://github.com/FedeArre/BetterDecals/releases/download/v1.0/Decals.zip)
2. Copy the Decals and Mods folders from the Decals.zip to the game's folder (where "My Garage.exe") is located.
3. Move your photos to be used as decals into the Decals folder. (.png / .jpg / .bmp are tested formats, other may work but weren't tested)
4. Your new custom decals will appear as part of the decals box. (Remember that the order of decals in the decal box is random)

Also, the mod allows to resize decals, for do this use the keys Z and X
- Z -> Do decal smaller
- X -> Do it bigger

Remember that making it too small or too big (if the original photo is small) will make it lose quality.
